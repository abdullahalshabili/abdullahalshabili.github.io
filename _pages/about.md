I am a PhD student at the Tandon School of Engineering at New York University, advised by [Prof. Ivan Selesnick](https://eeweb.engineering.nyu.edu/iselesni/). My research interests lie at the intersection of signal processing, optimization, and machine learning. I am broadly interested in deep learning and computational imaging. I graduated with a B.Sc./M.Sc, both in Electrical and Computer Engineering.


<!-- I received the BS, MEE, and PhD degrees in Electrical Engineering in 1990, 1991, and 1996 from Rice University, Houston, TX. I joined Polytechnic University in 1997 (now NYU Tandon School of Engineering) where I am currently a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. In 1997, I was a visiting professor at the University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany.

In past years, I have worked as a research fellow in the Visual Signal Analysis and Processing Center, KU, and Robotics Institute, KU and as an intern at ICUBE Laboratory at the University of Strasbourg. -->
