Abdullah Al-Shabili is a PhD student in the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, advised by [Prof. Ivan Selesnick](https://eeweb.engineering.nyu.edu/iselesni/). 
I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. from Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE in 2015 and 2017, respectively. I recieved the Ernst Weber Fellowship.

<!-- I received the BS, MEE, and PhD degrees in Electrical Engineering in 1990, 1991, and 1996 from Rice University, Houston, TX. I joined Polytechnic University in 1997 (now NYU Tandon School of Engineering) where I am currently a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. In 1997, I was a visiting professor at the University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany.

I received an Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship in 1997, and a National Science Foundation Career award in 1999. In 2003 I received the Jacobs Excellence in Education Award from Polytechnic University. As a PhD student I received a DARPA-NDSEG fellowship in 1991. My PhD dissertation received the Budd Award for Best Engineering Thesis at Rice University in 1996 and an award from the Rice-TMC chapter of Sigma Xi.


I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Toronto, supervised by Dimitrios Hatzinakos. I am also a Postgraduate affiliate to the Vector Institute . My research interests lie at the intersection of signal processing and machine learning implemented in application for health care and biometrics. I am broadly interested in deep learning, generative models and computer vision. I graduated with a B.Sc./M.Sc, both in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

In past years, I have worked as a research fellow in the Visual Signal Analysis and Processing Center, KU, and Robotics Institute, KU and as an intern at ICUBE Laboratory at the University of Strasbourg. -->
